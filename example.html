                            var: Function-scoped, can be redeclared and updated, hoisted with undefined.

                            let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.

                            const: Block-scoped, can be updated but not redeclared in the same scope.

                            Closures are created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner
                            function to "close over" the variables of the outer function.
